Question: A 66-year-old male who has been treated only for hypertension and had no previous diagnosis of atrial fibrillation, checked into emergency dept. because he had heart palpitations for the last 3 days. The patient was haemodynamically stable. ECG showed atrial fibrillation, with ventricle rate of ca. 135/min. Under these conditions, apart from initiating the anticoagulation treatment, you should: A)  stop atrial fibrillation by electrical cardioversion, regardless of arrhythmia duration, due to high HR. B)  stop atrial fibrillation by pharmacotherapy, regardless of arrhythmia duration, due to high HR, and if ineffective, perform electrical cardioversion. C)  slow down HR to the safe and well-tolerated level, without breaking arrhythmia. D)  slow down HR to the safe and well-tolerated level only after excluding the presence of thrombi in the heart chambers through transoesophageal echocardiography. E)  refer the patient to cardiology dept. for urgent ablation, in view of no previous diagnosis of atrial fibrillation and the high efficacy of ablation procedure when performed shortly after the onset of arrhythmia before it becomes persistent.",

Question: A female patient, 65 years of age, came to see her family doctor because of severe abdominal pain which has become more intense for the last few days. Over the last few months she has had alternating constipation and diarrhoea. Presently, she has had no bowel movement for a few days. Medical history revealed iron-deficiency anaemia diagnosed a few months before and arterial hypertension which has been poorly controlled as the patient is not fond of going to the doctor and she did not have any health complaints. On physical examination, the abdomen was distended and painful to touch, and increased intestinal peristalsis could be heard. Deep palpation was not possible due to abdominal tension. Indicate appropriate measures to be taken: A)  urgently refer the patient to hospital because of suspected intestinal obstruction. B)  refer the patient to hospital for elective abdominal diagnostics. C)  refer the patient to an outpatient clinic for abdominal X-ray in a standing position, to exclude intestinal obstruction.

Apart from that, he reports occasional lumbar pain and weakness which he thinks can be attributed to ageing. Laboratory tests showed blood calcium concentration 4 mmol/l (normal range: 2.1-2.6 mmol/l), creatinine 2.1 mg/dl (normal range: 0.6-1.3 mg/dl), and slight normocytic anaemia, with no other abnormalities.
